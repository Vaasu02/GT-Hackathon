# The AI Creative Studio

## Problem Statement
In the fast-paced world of digital marketing, businesses spend weeks and thousands of dollars designing slight variations of the same ad content. They need a way to generate high-quality, on-brand creatives instantly, without losing the identity of their physical product.

## Expected End Result
I built an "Auto-Creative Engine" that solves this.
- **Input**: A user simply uploads their Product Image (e.g., a shoe) and their Brand Logo.
- **Process**: The system automatically removes the background, understands the product, and places it into 3 unique, AI-generated professional settings.
- **Output**: A downloadable ZIP file containing high-resolution images and matching, catchy ad captions generated by LLMs.

## Technical Approach
To ensure the product looked exactly like the real product (and not a hallucination), I couldn't just use standard text-to-image generation.
1.  **Subject Preservation**: I used **Stability AI's Inpainting** technique. I first remove the background of the uploaded product, place it on a transparent canvas, and create a "mask" that tells the AI: *"Keep these pixels (the product) exactly as they are, but generate a luxury background around them."*
2.  **Orchestration**: I built a Next.js API route that chains these steps: Image Upload -> Background Removal -> Prompt Generation (Gemini) -> Image Inpainting (Stability) -> Logo Compositing (Sharp) -> Captioning.
3.  **User Experience**: I focused on a premium, dark-mode UI using Tailwind CSS to make the tool feel like professional software.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion.
- **AI Models**: Stability AI (Stable Image Core/Inpainting), Google Gemini 1.5 Flash.
- **Backend Processing**: Node.js, `sharp` (for image manipulation/masking), `jszip` (for bundling).
- **Language**: TypeScript.

## Challenges and Learnings
- **The Consistency Challenge**: My biggest challenge was preventing the AI from warping the product. I learned that using "Inpainting" with a strict mask is far superior to "Image-to-Image" for product photography.
- **Image Manipulation**: Handling binary image buffers and creating alpha masks programmatically in Node.js was tricky. I learned how to use the `sharp` library effectively to composite layers and manage transparency.
- **Prompt Engineering**: I discovered that separating the "Visual Description" (for Stability) from the "Ad Copy" (for the caption) gave much better results than trying to do it all at once.
